QuestForge
==========

QuestForge is a JavaScript-based RPG engine that runs in the browser. It
is particularly inspired by classic Final Fantasy games and tries to
recreate the NES look and feel.

This game engine is still under development and is still missing a lot
of functionality. I'm developing it as a pet project in my spare time.
As it matures, it will be possible to build you own games on top of the
QuestForge engine. The "launch title" I'm planning is called Mendel's
Flame. At the rate development is going, I'll probably never finish it,
but feel free to check it out.
